/*
    Terminology:
        base frame: frame relative to which transforms are computed for CapMap activities. Typically NOT the robot base or world frame. Instead, it is the base of the arm (usually the shoulder or shoulder parent link).

        configuration [of the robot arm]: a set of values for joint angles in the arm. Defined in joint space, not cartesian.

        configuration space [of the robot arm]: also known as joint space. The space of all possible joint angle value combinations for the robot arm.

        facing vector: a vector in the end effector frame which describes which direction the end effector faces. For example, this would be the normal to the palm plane, oriented from the back of the hand, through the hand, and out through the palm.

        [link] frame: a cartesian coordinate frame associated with a robot link. For example, the end effector frame is associated to the end effector.

        joint space [of the robot arm]: see configuration space.

        orientation [of a {link | the link's associated frame}]: the rotation between a base frame and the given link. Described by a rotation matrix. Specified by two vector pairs: 
                first pair: pointing vector (associated to the link frame) and its base frame correspondent, 
                second pair: facing vector (associated to the link frame) and its base frame correspondent. 
            The orientation transforms the link frame {pointing | facing} vector to its base frame correspondent.

        pointing vector: a vector in the end effector frame which describes which direction the end effector points to. For example, this would be a direction in the palm plane, parallel to the metacarpal bones, oriented from the wrist along the metacarpals.

        pose [of {the end effector | a link}]: position and orientation of a link in a cartesian space. Described by an affine matrix.

                   variance in pointing and facing vectors in neighbors from CapMap. This gives an estimate of the robotÂ´s ability to orient the end effector near the query pose. Higher variance is better.
                   average dot product between query {pointing | facing} vector and neighbors' {pointing | facing} vectors.
